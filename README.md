Create a new console application called NumberManipulator.

Assign Console.ReadLine() to a variable to get a number from the command line when the program is run, and then square, add 14, subtract 3 and print the result of the cumulative effect of this with Console.WriteLine().

Once your application compiles add it to a public GitHub repository and paste the link below.
